# AI-Styler

AI-Styler is a web application that leverages the power of the DALL-E2 OpenAI API to help you visualize different styles for your images. With AI-Styler, you can upload images of yourself and submit prompts to generate images that showcase how you would look with various styles. This project is built using React for the frontend and styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive design.
